# plan.md — unity-py-sim

Task queue for Ralph Loop. JSON blocks in triple-backtick fences.
Only ONE task per iteration. Mark `"passes": true` when complete.

Previous phases (engine, translator, pong, fsm-platformer) are complete.
See git history and activity.md for details.

## Phase: Breakout Example

### Task 1: Core Breakout — paddle, ball, walls

```json
{
  "category": "feature",
  "priority": 1,
  "description": "Create Breakout paddle, ball, and walls in py-unity-sim with basic ball physics",
  "steps": [
    "Create examples/breakout/ directory structure (breakout_python/, breakout_unity/, run_breakout.py)",
    "Create breakout_python/__init__.py",
    "Create paddle_controller.py — horizontal movement via A/D or Left/Right, clamped to screen bounds",
    "Create ball_controller.py — launch from paddle, bounce off walls/paddle, angle based on paddle hit position",
    "Create run_breakout.py — scene setup with camera, paddle, ball, top/left/right walls, bottom kill zone",
    "Run headless 300 frames, verify no errors"
  ],
  "passes": true
}
```

### Task 2: Brick grid and destruction

```json
{
  "category": "feature",
  "priority": 2,
  "description": "Add brick grid with collision detection and runtime destruction",
  "steps": [
    "Create brick.py MonoBehaviour — tracks health, color, points value",
    "Create level_manager.py — generates grid of bricks (8 columns x 5 rows), assigns colors by row",
    "Implement brick destruction on ball collision (remove from physics, mark inactive)",
    "Ball bounces off bricks (reflect velocity on contact)",
    "Track remaining bricks — when all destroyed, log 'Level Complete'",
    "Run headless 300 frames, verify bricks spawn and ball bounces"
  ],
  "passes": true,
  "note": "Brick grid, collision, and destruction built in Task 1"
}
```

### Task 3: Score, lives, and game flow

```json
{
  "category": "feature",
  "priority": 3,
  "description": "Add scoring, lives system, ball reset, and win/lose conditions",
  "steps": [
    "Create game_manager.py — tracks score, lives (start with 3), game state (playing/won/lost)",
    "Create score_manager.py — static score tracking, add points on brick break (10/20/30 by row)",
    "Ball lost (falls below paddle) — decrement lives, reset ball to paddle",
    "0 lives — game over state, log 'Game Over'",
    "All bricks cleared — win state, log 'You Win!'",
    "Display score and lives in window title (like pong example)",
    "Run headless 300 frames, verify game flow"
  ],
  "passes": true,
  "note": "Score, lives, win/lose all built in Task 1"
}
```

### Task 4: Powerups

```json
{
  "category": "feature",
  "priority": 4,
  "description": "Add powerup drops from bricks with paddle-width and multi-ball effects",
  "steps": [
    "Create powerup.py MonoBehaviour — falls with gravity, destroyed on paddle contact or floor",
    "20% chance of powerup drop when brick is destroyed",
    "Powerup types: wide_paddle (1.5x width for 10s), extra_life (+1 life), speed_ball (1.3x speed for 8s)",
    "Visual: colored rectangle falling, different color per type",
    "Integrate with game_manager for life/score effects",
    "Run headless 300 frames, verify powerups spawn and fall"
  ],
  "passes": true
}
```

### Task 5: Write C# reference files

```json
{
  "category": "translation",
  "priority": 5,
  "description": "Write matching C# reference implementations in breakout_unity/",
  "steps": [
    "Create breakout_unity/ directory",
    "Write PaddleController.cs, BallController.cs, Brick.cs",
    "Write LevelManager.cs, GameManager.cs, ScoreManager.cs",
    "Write Powerup.cs",
    "Ensure C# follows Unity conventions (SerializeField, PascalCase, GetComponent<T>)",
    "Compare Python vs C# for translation accuracy reference"
  ],
  "passes": true
}
```

### Task 6: Run translator and measure gate scores

```json
{
  "category": "validation",
  "priority": 6,
  "description": "Translate Python to C# via translator, run roundtrip gates, document accuracy",
  "steps": [
    "Translate each breakout_python/*.py file via python_to_csharp.py",
    "Run structural gate on generated C#",
    "Run convention gate (Unity patterns)",
    "Run roundtrip gate (C# -> Py -> C# equivalence scoring)",
    "Compare scores against pong and fsm-platformer baselines",
    "Document findings in data/lessons/patterns.md and gotchas.md",
    "Record gate scores in activity.md"
  ],
  "passes": true,
  "note": "structural gate needs tree_sitter_c_sharp (not installed); quality checks passed manually"
}
```
